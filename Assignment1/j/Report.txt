The data for the first part of the assignment was generated with the generateData function, which allows to create a certain number of clusters using a determined amount of random numbers. The function was used to generate 2 clusters using 1000 data points in the following manner:

[data cp classes] = generateData(1, 0.5, 2, 15, 15, 5, 1, 2, 1000);

The classes variables states to which cluster it belongs, and the numbers start with 1 and rise in increments of one. We can check this with the tabulate command:

tabulate(classes)
  Value    Count   Percent
    1      439     43.90%
    2      561     56.10%
	
In our case there's 439 points in class 1 and 561 points in class 2. Now, the classes have to be adjusted to be in line with the assignment. Class 1 will become class -1 and class 2 will become class -1. To do so, the following commands were used:

classes(classes == 1) = -1;
classes(classes == 2) = 1;
